# Proof Of Concept

## Proof of Concept(POC) Name:
Upload user statistical data

## Functionality in this POC
A preexisting user will upload statistical data for a game of his choosing. The user will choose from a list of games and upload personal data into the database.
The POC will contain the logic to ensure that no illegitimate data/statistics can be uploaded.

## Data Store
All database tables will already be filled in. The test user will update an existing table with additional data.

## Assumptions
User account setup, friends list functionality and delete data is already in place. It will not be showcased in this POC.

## Assumptions
User account setup, friends list functionality and delete data is already in place. It will not be showcased in this POC.
